>This version provide a bi-directional comunication between two nodes using two different pipes to catch the Round trip
Time of flight. To compute the distance separing the two node is giveb by a simple formule as follows :
					D=C*ToF(2)/2
where 	D: is the distance between the two node.
	C: is the speed of light.
	ToF(2):is the round trip time of flight. 
>The code is very clean taking care of almoust all possible defective in the transmisson
(sending,receiving, depassing the Time to leave...).
>I spent too much time testing this code, but i faced several hardware problems (pins, cables ..), and after fixing 
those problems the result i ended with is a distance D= 1 555 m   

>Notes:
The appropriet way to establish the communication using two pipes, is to give an adresse (pipe) to read from and 
another adresse(pipe) to write in to a corresponding node and inversing the adresses for the other node. 
We divide by two because ToF(2) is keeping track of the time spent between the sent and a reception in the same node
assuming that receiving and preapring the message consume the same amount of time in the two nodes.
